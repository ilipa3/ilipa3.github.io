        Indonesia is one of the most polluted countries in the world. Air pollution occurs due to the existence of one or more physical, chemical or biological substances in the atmosphere, where this amount can endanger the health of humans, animals, and plants. Air pollution in Indonesia especially in Jakarta can be caused by some unsavory human behavior. For instance, burning garbage, forests that are deliberately set on fire by humans, excessive use of electricity which means burning coal must be carried out on a very large scale, even up to 58 million tons a year. Air pollution caused by human activities can have an impact on global warming. Global warming itself is a phenomenon where the earth's average temperature rises due to increased amounts of greenhouse gasses. Greenhouse gasses such as carbon dioxide, methane and ozone trap the incoming radiation from the sun. Global warming can trigger several disasters or crises, for example wildland fire due to high temperatures and dry and arid places. Global warming can also make sea water rise due to melting polar ice which can cause several small islands and islands below sea level to sink. The world will also undergo a water crisis because rising air temperatures can accelerate water evaporation. Now burning coal is the largest contributor of carbon dioxide, which is approximately 35%. Basically, the energy that humans use has actually been provided and already exists in nature, so that humans themselves can get it directly. However, the amount of energy in nature is very limited and in the process of its utilization it can damage nature. Therefore, humans began to look for other energy, namely alternative energy. Alternative energy can be in the form of solar power, hydro power, and wind power. Now Indonesia is starting the development of wind power as a power plant. Indonesia itself has the potential for wind power plants of 60.6 GW (Giga Watt), however, currently only a small amount of potential has been utilized by the government. In this research, we focus on human efforts to deal with and reduce global warming, specifically in terms of air pollution. We hope that this mockup experiment and simulation can help reduce air pollution.    </p>
